# peak_timing_example Hadwin, Adam tends to reach baseline by event 0.0 (based on 5 seasons), indicating early-season readiness.
# peak_timing_example Phillips, Chandler typically reaches baseline after event 6 (avg 342.0 over 3 seasons), suggesting a later peak.
# peak_timing_example Hubbard, Mark typically reaches baseline after event 6 (avg 140.4 over 6 seasons), suggesting a later peak.
# peak_timing_example Lee, S.T. typically reaches baseline after event 6 (avg 134.9 over 1 seasons), suggesting a later peak.
