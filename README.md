# Google Apps Scripts Repo

This repository is a workspace to store Google Apps Script projects locally.

## Pulling all Apps Script projects into this repo

I added a helper script that lists your Google Apps Script projects (via `clasp`) and clones or updates them into the `apps-scripts/` directory.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- clasp: install globally with `npm install -g @google/clasp`
- jq: JSON processor (e.g. `sudo apt install jq` on Debian/Ubuntu)

## Development Environment

This repository is designed to work with GitHub Codespaces for a consistent development environment.

**Managing Codespace:**
```bash
# Stop the current codespace
gh codespace stop -c animated-bassoon

# List all codespaces
gh codespace list

# Create a new codespace
gh codespace create
```

## Usage

1. Authenticate with Google:
   ```bash
   clasp login
   ```

2. Run the helper script (multiple options):

   **Auto-discover projects:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pull_apps_scripts.sh
   ```

   **Pull specific script IDs:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pull_apps_scripts.sh SCRIPT_ID1 SCRIPT_ID2 ...
   ```

   **Pull from script-ids.txt file:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pull_apps_scripts.sh --from-file script-ids.txt
   ```

The script will create `apps-scripts/` and clone each project into a folder named with the project title (e.g., `ADS_Sales_Operations`).

## Finding Script IDs

If `clasp list` doesn't show your projects, you can find script IDs by:

1. Visit [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Open any project
3. Copy the script ID from the URL: `https://script.google.com/d/[SCRIPT_ID]/edit`
4. Add script IDs to `script-ids.txt` (one per line) or pass them as arguments

## Pushing Changes Back to Production

After editing your Apps Script files locally, push changes back to Google Apps Script:

**Push all projects:**
```bash
./scripts/push_to_production.sh
```

**Push specific project:**
```bash
./scripts/push_to_production.sh ADS_Sales_Operations
```

**Push and create deployment:**
```bash
./scripts/push_to_production.sh --deploy Golf_Algorithm
```

**List available projects:**
```bash
./scripts/push_to_production.sh --list
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pull_apps_scripts.sh --from-file script-ids.txt
   ```

2. **Edit files locally** in your preferred editor (VS Code, etc.)

3. **Test changes** (optional): Visit script.google.com and test in the web editor

4. **Push to production:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/push_to_production.sh ProjectName
   ```

5. **Commit to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "Update ProjectName: description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Notes

- If a project is already present, the script runs `clasp pull` to update it.
- The script handles cases where `clasp list` doesn't work (common issue).
- Comments and empty lines in `script-ids.txt` are ignored.
- Each project has a `.clasp.json` file linking it to the Google Apps Script project.
- Use `clasp push` to update code, `clasp deploy` to create new versions.
- If you'd like a GitHub Action to sync projects automatically, open an issue and I can add an optional workflow.
